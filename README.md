# Brain-friendly-language-materials

This is a work in progress.

The purpose of this project is to create language materials that are in line with the Comprehension Hypothesis, introduced by Stephen Krashen. 

Another major goal is to document the techniques and strategies that are conducive to comprehensible and compelling language materials.

Some of these are:

Strict control of vocabulary (introduction of new words)
Use of pictures
Circling questioning
