# Brain-friendly-language-materials

**_This is a work in progress._**

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to make learning a new language easier by applying the Comprehension Hypothesis, introduced by Stephen Krashen. 

## STRUCTURE
The project is going to be divided in two parts:
* Narrated stories
* List of books ranked by readability

## ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
Supporting those two parts, a range of materials will be available.
For the narrated stories:
* Techniques and strategies that are conducive to comprehensible and compelling language materials.

Some of these are:

* Strict control of vocabulary (introduction of new words),
* Use of pictures,
* Circling questioning, etc

For the list of books: 
* theory, readability measures implemented in Python and some graphs

The scripts have been used as LibreOffice macros. Also, as of now, they can only process txt files. 

## INSPIRATION
The inspiration for this project come from books like Lingua Latina per se illustrata, a book for learning Latin that doesn't contain a single word in any other language.
One extremely important feature of that kind of book is that it is suitable for native-speakers of whatever language.
Other projects from which we draw inspiration are:

* TPR (Total Physical Response)
* TPRS (Total Physical Response Storytelling or alternatively Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling)
* ALG (Automatic Language Growth)

## TODO

* Modify the scripts to work with epub files. Find a library to do so.
* Create the plots with gnuplot.
* Create the scripts to download the corpora.
..* Torify them to protect the users.
* Add links to inspiring projects.
